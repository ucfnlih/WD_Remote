# Classification

## Summary

Remote sensing images usually contain a lot of information, such as vegetation, sea, buildings, etc. These different classifications of information appear more complex in urban areas. When using remote sensing data for research, it is common to use some classified information instead of all, which is called classified data. The land cover is one of the typical and popular classified data, which is useful for urban planning and Disaster detection. For example, using EO data to detect urban green area achieve the physical accessibility, which improves the efficiency of government monitoring urban expansion and land use [(Giuliani et al., 2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/3/422). And in the most cited paper on forest fire, different types of vegetation are detected from Landsat image to identify the flammable trees and obtain a fire hazard map[(Chuvieco and Congalton, 1989)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034425789900230).

**But how can we extract such information?** This will involve machine learning, which is science of computer modeling of learning process.

[Machine learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) is based on data and it can help us make decisions or predictions without explicit programming, which also known as training. There are many models in machine learning, including the linear regression model that many people are familiar with and some complex models such as tree-based model and neural network. In remote sensing area, tree-based model is mainly used to identiy. image. Tree-based model uses different input variables to make complex decisions, of which classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest models are most commonly used.
