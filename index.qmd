## WHO AM I ?

### I am Wendi Li

A master student from Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), UCL. My undergraduate degree is from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, majoring in logistics management. What motivated me to change my major and enter CASA is my keen interest in data science and urban studies. Now my research interests are focusing on data visualization, web gis and connected environment. I have a love and aspirations for academic research and desire for progress. I would appreciate your comments on my learning diary and welcome you to discuss with me!
