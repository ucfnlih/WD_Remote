# 1 Getting start with remote sensing

This week, we have a preliminary understanding of the concept of remote sensing and how it is implemented. This is the basis for starting out interesting journey of remote sensing!

## Summary

Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object (from a distance), which is one of the specific methods of Earth observation. Remote sensing is an interesting and useful field with mass of data, it can detect the urban phenomena from a broader perspective and support for policy development. However, satellites also bring space junk. According to statistics, there are [3,000 dead satellites and around 34,000 pieces bigger than 10 centimetres in size littering space](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/what-is-space-junk-and-why-is-it-a-problem.html), which increases the hitting risk.

Remote sensing is achieved through sensors, which can be on satellites or mounted on aircraft. There are two main categories of remote sensors, active sensors and passive sensors. Passive sensors receive and detect electromagnetic waves emitted by the target itself or reflected radiation from nature, with no emission source of its own. While active sensors emit electromagnetic waves to the target, which in turn receives their reflection. Each sensor has its own strengths and weaknesses (Figure 1), and using them in combination typically results in more accurate prediction data.

<br/> Raster data is the most common remote sensing data format, and its encoding methods mainly includes band interleaved by line (BIL), band sequential (BSQ), band interleaved by pixel (BIP) adn GeoTIFF (most common). **To measure the quality and potential detail of imagery, four resolutions are used as metrics:**

-   **Spatial Resolution** <br/> *Size of the raster grid per pixel. Describing how detailed objects are in an image.*

-   **Spectral Resolution**<br/> *Number and size of bands that a remote sensing platform can capture*<br/>

    -   Wavelength<br/>
    -   Spectral signature (discrete or continuous)<br/>
    -   Constrained to atmospheric windows<br/>
    -   Measuring spectral reflectance - spectroradiometer

-   **Temporal Resolution**<br/> *Revisit time of sensor, which refers to the frequency at which imagery is recorded for a particular area.*

-   **Radiometric Resolution**<br/> *The amount of information in each pixel, which refers to the ability of a sensor to identify and show small differences in energy*

## Application

#### Application of Landsat Data In Estimating Soil Moisture

# Paper

Li, B., Ti, C., Zhao, Y., Yan, X., 2016. **Estimating Soil Moisture with Landsat Data and Its Application in Extracting the Spatial Distribution of Winter Flooded Paddies**. Remote Sensing 8, 38. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8010038
:::

This paper focuses on winter flooded paddies, the purpose is to present a procedure for the extraction of WFP using multi-temporal surface soil moisture content imagery in order to Winter improve the accuracy of agricultural detection.

The methodology related to remote sensing has two parts. In the "Tasseled Cap Transformation" part, a set of 10 consecutive pairs of clear/near cloud-free Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and OLI images are selected and implemented the tasseled Cap transformation to eliminate the impact of scattering (the picture below). In the second part, using the Landsat data to consider the soil moisture estimation.

## My comment on methodology

This paper uses classical Tasseled Cap Transformation to deal with the images, which is a very useful methods to reduce the dimensionality and make it easier to analyze. What's more, TCT can improve the separability of different land cover classes, which makes it distinguish easily. However, TCT can only be corrected for atmosphere, and the paper does not mention other correction methods, which may cause other errors. This is what the study can be improved.

## Personal Reflection

This week I started my formal study of remote sensing, which is a new field for me and I was really excited. The lecture and practical focus on the basics of sensors and remote sensing data. For me, what attracted me most are the Landsat data because of its wide range of data and long time span, which can provide so much information to our research.

I think the landsat data bring me both "opportunities" and challenges. I will have much more data in subsequent study and can explore some problems from an aerial perspective rather than just using panel data. This has greatly broadened my research horizon. But at the same time, I think it is not really easy to be proficient in landsat data, which requires a lot of accumulation and practice. Therefore, the rode of remote sensing is long, but I think more interets would be discovered in the following secetions.
